## 0x1B. C - Sorting algorithms & Big O

Sorting Algorithms are at the center of data handling and very key in arranging any given elements in a desired order. The efficiency of the different algorithms can be determined using Big O notation. Big O tells the worst time and space complexity of the algorithm in use and is very important in selecting the most appropriate sorting algorithm.
Each of the different tasks in this directory showcases a different type of sorting algorithm and its functionality.
